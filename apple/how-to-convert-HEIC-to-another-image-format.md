## How to convert HEIC image to another image format

This trick I learned a while ago as I need to convert pictures from iPhone to a more common format as PNG or JPEG.
HEIC is a format of Apple used for pictures.

You can convert an HEIC image to JPEG on macOS by using Apple Preview. 

1. Open the HEIC image in Preview
2. Go to File --> Export
3. Choose the format you want to export to
4. Click on Save and your file is converted
