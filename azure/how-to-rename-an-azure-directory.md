## How to rename an Azure Directory

For years, my Azure Portal was named Default and today I decided to change it to KaizenItConsulting (my company).

If you want to change the name do the following:

1. Open your Azure Active Directory
2. Go to properties blade
3. You get an overview of the Tenant properties where you will find a textbox with name.
4. Change the name to whatever you want and click save.
